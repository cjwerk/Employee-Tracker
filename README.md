# Employee-Tracker

Here is a fully function employee tracker database. In this program you can add employees and view existing ones as well as update roles and
remove employees as needed. All you have to do is start the program and all that power is at your finger tips. Made through the power of MySQL
as well as Node.js and JavaScript. The link to the repo is https://github.com/cjwerk/Employee-Tracker and the demestration video link is https://github.com/cjwerk/Employee-Tracker go check it out and see for yourself.



Made by the awesomness of

Node.js
JavaScript
MySQL
